# Prisma CRUD API Assignment

## 1. Easy Task
### Endpoints:
1. "/add-song"
2. "/get-songs"

## 2. Medium Task
Created endpoints for both models, as much for the practice as I felt it was needed to make a bit more sense of the assignment.

### Endpoints:
1. "/add-event" - pretty similar to "/add-song".
2. "/get-events" - also similar to "/get-songs".
3. "/add-rsvp" - connected to the eventId, and should only accept "GOING", "NOT_GOING" and "MAYBE".
4. "/get-rsvps/:eventId" - gets the rsvps to the targeted event, if there are any.

## 3. Hard Task
Added a student model, in order to give each student the possibility of getting a record of their completed assignments.
